## About the project
Gyroflow is an application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and this application stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

- For cameras which don't have built-in gyro, please consider using Betaflight FC or check out our [flowshutter](https://github.com/gyroflow/flowshutter) project.

## Installation
### Windows
- Download `Gyroflow-windows64.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/releases) page, extract the files somewhere and run `Gyroflow.exe`
- If it shows an error about `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, [install VC redist](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

### MacOS
- Download `Gyroflow-mac-universal.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/releases) page, run the downloaded file, and drag & drop `Gyroflow` app to the Applications folder (or anywhere you want, like on Desktop)
- You can also install using brew: `brew install gyroflow`. To upgrade Gyroflow, run `brew update` then `brew upgrade gyroflow`

### Linux
- Download `Gyroflow-linux64.tar.gz` from the [Releases](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/releases) page, extract the files somewhere and run `./Gyroflow` in the terminal.
- If that doesn't work, you can try the `Gyroflow-linux64.AppImage`, but the .tar.gz one is preferred.
- Make sure you have latest graphics drivers installed
- Possibly needed packages: `sudo apt install libva2 libvdpau1 libasound2 libxkbcommon0 libpulse0libc++-dev vdpau-va-driver libvulkan1`

Help us translate *Gyroflow* to your language! We use *crowdin* to manage translations and you can contribute there: https://crowdin.com/project/gyroflow

#### I want to contribute but I don't know Rust or QML
* The Rust book is a great way to get started with Rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
* Additional useful resources for Rust: https://quickref.me/rust and https://cheats.rs/
* For the UI stuff, there's a nice QML book by The Qt Company: https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/qml-book


## Development
### Used languages and technologies
*Gyroflow* is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with UI written in [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlfirststeps.html). It uses *Qt*, *ffmpeg*, *OpenCV* and *mdk-sdk* external dependencies for the main program, but the core library is written in pure Rust without any external dependencies.

OpenCV usage is kept to a minimum, used only for lens calibration and optical flow (`src/core/calibration/mod.rs` and `src/core/synchronization/opencv.rs`). Core algorithms and undistortion don't use OpenCV.

GPU stuff supports *DirectX*, *OpenGL*, *Metal* and *Vulkan* thanks to *Qt RHI* and *wgpu*.
For GPU processing we use *OpenCL* or *wgpu*, with highly parallelized CPU implementation as a fallback.

### Code structure
1. Entire GUI is in the `src/ui` directory
2. `src/controller.rs` is a bridge between UI and core, it takes all commands from QML and calls functions in core
3. `src/core` contains the whole gyroflow engine and doesn't depend on *Qt* or *ffmpeg*, and *OpenCV* is optional
4. `src/rendering` contains all FFmpeg related code for rendering final video and processing for synchronization
5. `src/core/gpu` contains GPU implementations of the undistortion
6. `src/qt_gpu` contains zero-copy GPU undistortion path, using Qt RHI and GLSL compute shader, but this method is experimental and buggy for now
7. `src/gyroflow.rs` is the main entry point
8. `mod.rs` or `lib.rs` in each directory act as a main entry of the module (directory name is the module name and `mod.rs` is kind of an entry point)

### Dev environment
`Visual Studio Code` with `rust-analyzer` extension.

For working with QML I recommend to use Qt Creator and load all QML files there, as it has auto-complete and syntax highlighting.
The project also supports UI live reload, it's a super quick way of working with the UI. Just change `live_reload = true` in `gyroflow.rs` and it should work right away. Now every time you change any QML file, the app should reload it immediately.

### Building on Windows
1. Get latest stable Rust language from: https://rustup.rs/
    - Please make sure to check the English language pack option when installing the C++ build tools from Visual Studio Installer
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow.git`
3. Install dependencies to the `ext` directory: `cd gyroflow/ext`
    - `Qt 6.3.1` or higher: `pip3 install -U pip & pip3 install aqtinstall` then `aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.3.1 win64_msvc2019_64 -m qtshadertools` or use the [official installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
    - `FFmpeg 5.0`: download [ffmpeg 5.0 lite](https://sourceforge.net/projects/avbuild/files/windows-desktop/ffmpeg-5.0-windows-desktop-vs2022-gpl-lite.7z/download) and unzip it to `ext/ffmpeg-5.0-windows-desktop-vs2022-gpl-lite`
    - vcpkg: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git & .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics`
    - OpenCV: `.\vcpkg\vcpkg install "opencv[core]:x64-windows-release"`
    - OpenCL: `.\vcpkg\vcpkg install "opencl:x64-windows-release"`
    - LLVM: download and install [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-13.0.0/LLVM-13.0.0-win64.exe)
4. Make sure you have `7z` in PATH.
5. Setup the environment in powershell (or set the same variables in cmd): `./__env.ps1` - I do this in VS Code built-in terminal
    - some machines might have issue that scripts are forbidden to run, try to `set-executionpolicy remotesigned` in powershell with admin
6. Compile and run: `cargo run --release`

### Building on MacOS
1. Get latest stable Rust language from: https://rustup.rs/
2. Install Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`
3. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow.git`
4. Install dependencies: `cd gyroflow/ext && ./install-deps-mac.sh`
5. For building on Apple M1, change `ffmpeg-x64_64` -> `ffmpeg-arm64` and `x64-osx-release` -> `arm64-osx` in `__env-macos.sh`
6. Setup the environment in terminal: `source __env-macos.sh` or `. ./__env-macos.sh` - I do this in VS Code built-in terminal
7. For some reason `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` may be overwritten so export it again in terminal: `export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="$(xcode-select --print-path)/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/"` (if you have build errors, try the other one from __env-macos.sh)
8. Compile and run: `cargo run --release`
9. If it fails to run, do: `./_deployment/deploy-macos.sh` once

### Building on Linux
1. Get latest stable Rust language from: https://rustup.rs/
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow.git`
3. Install dependencies: `cd gyroflow/ext && ./install-deps-linux.sh` (Debian based apt)
4. Setup the environment in terminal: `./__env-linux.sh` - I do this in VS Code built-in terminal
5. Compile and run: `cargo run --release`

### Building for Android
1. Android is not well supported yet, but the app can be built and somewhat works. So far only building on Windows was tested
2. Install Qt for Android: `aqt install-qt windows android 6.3.1 android_arm64_v8a` and `aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.3.1 win64_mingw`
3. Install `cargo-apk`: `cargo install --git https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs.git cargo-apk`
4. Add a Rust target: `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android`
5. Update `Cargo.toml` to comment out `[[[bin]]` section and uncomment `[lib]` section
6. Patch `C:\Users\you\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\opencv-0.61.3\build.rs`: Change `if cfg!(target_env = "msvc")` to `if std::env::var("CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ENV").unwrap() == "msvc"`
7. Update paths in `_deployment/build-android.ps1`
8. Run `.\_deployment\build-android.ps1` in Powershell

### Profiling on Windows
1. Install and run `Visual Studio Community Edition`
2. Compile and run GyroFlow with the `profile` profile: `cargo run --profile profile`
3. In Visual Studio, go to `Debug -> Performance Profiler...`
    - Under `Target`, open `Change Target` and select `Running Process...`, select the running `gyroflow.exe` process
