## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Gyroflow Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://docs.gyroflow.xyz).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

The best place to ask questions is the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BBJ2UVAr2D).

If you don't want to use Discord, you can also use the issue tracker, however Discord is encouraged.

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://docs.gyroflow.xyz). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflowissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Gyroflow, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the [latest dev version](https://gyroflow.xyz/devbuild/?autodownload).
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.gyroflow.xyz) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Gyroflow users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Your First Code Contribution

- First you'll need to build Gyroflow locally, you can follow the steps in README or in the [documentation](https://docs.gyroflow.xyz/app/technical-details/building-from-source).
- You can then proceed to implementing your changes.
- Once you are confident your change is working well and is useful for others, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/pulls)
- Someone from the team will review your PR and hopefully it will be merged to upstream project.

### Improving The Documentation

The documentation is hosted at https://github.com/gyroflow/docs.gyroflow.xyz. Feel free to submit a PR there in order to improve the documentation.
